    <h2>El Filibusterismo</h2>

    <p>
    The death of Capitan Tiago and Basilio’s imprisonment were soon reported in the province, 
    and to the honor of the simple inhabitants of San Diego, let it be recorded that the latter 
    was an incident more regretted and almost the only one discussed. As was to be expected, 
    the report took on different forms, sad and startling details were given, what could not be 
    understood was explained, the gaps being filled by conjectures, which soon passed for 
    accomplished facts, and the phantoms thus created terrified their own creators.

    In the town of Tiani it was reported that at least, at the very least, the young man was 
    going to be deported and would very probably be murdered on the journey. The timorous and 
    pessimistic were not satisfied with this but even talked about executions and courts-martial—
    January was a fatal month; in January the Cavite affair had occurred, and they even thought 
    curates had been garroted, so a poor Basilio without protectors or friends—

    “I told him so.”

    “It was to be expected,” commented Sister Penchang. “He would go into the church, and when 
    he saw that the holy water was somewhat dirty, he wouldn’t cross himself with it. He talked 
    about germs and disease, abá, it’s the chastisement of God! He deserved it, and he got it! 
    As though the holy water could transmit diseases! Quite the contrary, abá!”
